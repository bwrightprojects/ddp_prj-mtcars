### Welcome to the MPG predictor

This application is based on the mtcars R dataset.  

## Format

A data frame with 32 observations on 11 variables.

1. `mpg` Miles/(US) gallon
1. `cyl` Number of cylinders 
1. `disp` Displacement (cu.in.) 
1. `hp` Gross horsepower 
1. `drat` Rear axle ratio 
1. `wt` Weight (lb/1000) 
1. `qsec` 1/4 mile time 
1. `vs` V-engine / Standard 
1. `am` Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual) 
1. `gear` Number of forward gears 
1. `carb` Number of carburetors 


Source code is available on the https://github.com/bwrightprojects/ddp_prj-mtcars (right clickd and open in a new tab/window)

A simple and yet, possible bad linear regression model is used to predict the MPG based on the type of transmission (am), 1/4 mile time (qsec) and Weight (wt).  

This is just an example of a prediciton model to compare to the published Miles/(US) gallon (mpg).
